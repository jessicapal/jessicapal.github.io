        <h2 class="heading">Mt. Fremont Lookout (Washington)</h2>
      </header>
			
	  Mt. Fremont Lookout is one of the best hikes I have ever completed. It is located about 2 hrs from Seattle, WA in the Mt. Rainier 
	  National Park. It is a 5.6 miles roundtrip hike. I started this hike around 3am with a few friends, hoping to catch the sunrise 
	  on top of the mountain. It was so dark outside, but the sky was magical. You could see every single star in the clear night sky. 
	  We hiked and reached the top of the mountain around 5am, after a few wrong turns on the trail. I was definitely scared of hiking 
	  in the dark, but it was such a breathtaking view every time I looked up to the sky. Once we reached the top of the mountain, 
	  where the fire lookout is located, we suddently felt very cold. We were all inadequately clothed, not prepared for the wind and 
	  the cold weather. We wrapped ourselves in an emergency blanket as we waited for the sunrise. We were sitting on top of a mountain 
	  with clouds all around us. Around 6:30am we started to see the sun rising, and it was such a memorable experience.The sun was 
	  peeking out from below the clouds and rising above them. We watched the sky change colors and the clouds move away. The sky 
	  changed from dark blue to light blue as shades of yellow and orange brightened the sky. After spending an hour watching the 
	  sunrise and admiring the views around us in the cold temperatures, we started to head back. As we decreased our elecation, we 
	  started to feel warmer air around us, and we explored the trail that was almost invisible as we were hiking up. This is 
	  definitely my favorite hike in Washington, and I cannot wait to go back. Memories were made, with amazing friends and spectacular
	  views. I recommed everyone to hike the Mt. Fremont Lookout trail to watch the sunrise. You will not be disappointed. It is 
	  magnificent and definitely worth losing sleep for. It is simply a gorgeous hike.</p>

        <h2 class="heading"> Sinaloa, Mexico </h2>
      </header>
			
	  <p> Sinaloa is a state located on the west side of Mexico. It is next to the Pacific Ocean letting the state have amazing beaches and delicious foods.
	  I used to spend my childhood there traveling every summer and winter break I got from school, since it was my parents' birthplace. I would visit major
	  cities such as Mazatlan and Culiacan spending time with family and friends. My parents grew up in a small ranch town about an hour south of Mazatlan.
	  I would enjoy waking up in the morning to go ride horses, release the cows from their pens, and plant different sort of vegetables and fruits for the
	  harvesting season. I enjoyed it because it helped me relax and be away from technology and being able to take in the fresh air. It taught me to stay
	  humble and see the opportunities that I get living in the states. I would enjoy going to the local plaza Sunday nights where the locals would spend
	  their nights dancing to music, vendors selling their items, and people overall having a good time. When we weren't in the farms, my uncle and I would
	  spend time in the local marina fishing for either fish, crabs, or shrimp. Since we are on the coast there is a lot of seafood, and it is cooked in all
	  sorts of ways. Even though it was my vacation time I would spend time working with my friends since it was their livelihood and what they used to help
	  their families or keep the money for themselves. I saw the difference between living in the states and living in another country such as, being independent
	  and trying to find answers your own way. There were some culture shocks such as having to heat up water to be able to take a shower without the water being
	  cold or infrastructure plumbing having to use a bucket of water to flush the toilet. There were some good things such as if we got hungry, we could just go
	  catch something and eat it for lunch or dinner without worrying that we might not eat for the day. Living the ranch lifestyle was a bit laid back not like
	  living in a major city. Whenever I would stay in a city like Mazatlan with my family, we would go to pier and watch people jump or cliffs into the ocean
	  or grab a bite to eat. Staying in Mazatlan and Culiacan did remind me of being in the states by having to use cars to move from point A to point B. In the
          ranch we would walk wherever we needed to or bike around town. </p>

	<h2 class="heading"> Puebla, Mexico </h2> 
   </header> 
	
	<p> Puebla, a state located east-central of Mexico. It is known for its culinary history, architecture, pottery and most importantly, the volcanoes residing in Puebla. 
	Two of the most know vocanoes are Popocatepelt and Iztaccihuatl. Popocatepelt is an active stratovalcano while Iztaccihuatl is a dormant volcanic Mountain. 
	Both my parents and I are from Puebla and growing up I would hear stories from my mother of the eruptions of the volcano Popocatepelt. She told me that when she was a teenager, 
	her room had a window facing Popocatepelt and one night she saw it erupt. She described it as a pretty sight but at the same time scary since the town she is from is close 
	to the volcano and they would often suffer from the eruptions, like volcanic ashes. </p> 

<header class="header">
	<h2 class="heading"> Legend of Popocatepelt and Iztaccihuatl </h2> 
</header> 

	<p> During the time when the Aztec Empire dominated the Valley of Mexico, the chief had a daughter, Iztaccihuatl, She was the most beautiful of all princesses and
	she was in love with Popocatepelt. Popocatepelt was one of the Chiefs Warrior and though he was young he was one of the best warriors the Chief had. When Popocatepelt 
	went to the chief to ask for his daughters hand, the cheif was hesitante for Popocatepelt wasn't of a noble family. With a condition, that Popocatepelt brought the head 
	of the genreral of the mexicas, he would accept the marriage between Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepelt. Popocatepelt left to war with the mexicas and afterwards, a love rival of his,
	told Princess Iztaccihuatl that her beloved had died in combat. </p>

	<p> Heart broken by the news, the princess entered a great depression and as days passed she died out of sadness. Popocatepelt return home happy that he would soon marry Izta.
	Upon his arrival, he was greeted with the news that Iztaccihualt had died thinking he was dead. After killing his love rival for not only leaving the war when it got difficult
	but also for lying to his beloved, he took Izta to the top of the moutain where he laid her down in a bed of flowers. He laid there with her, never leaving her side. 
	One of the gods, Tezcatlipoca, was moved by the love Popoca had for Itza and turned both of them into Volcanoes. </p>
